# 🚀 Vehicle Tracking System

Welcome to the Vehicle Tracking System, a modern solution for efficiently tracking and managing vehicles. This project provides a visual and interactive experience using maps and dynamic data visualization.

## ✨ Features

- 🚗 **Vehicle List Pagination** – Browse through a structured table of vehicles with pagination. By implementing pagination, data loading time is significantly reduced.
- 🗺 **Interactive Map Integration** – Click on a vehicle to focus the map on its location and display relevant data. When you click the back button, you will be navigated to the vehicle list, where the last selected vehicle will be highlighted.
- 🔍 **Data Persistence** – Efficient caching with optimized API calls. By storing data in local storage, the app reduces unnecessary requests. Errors are handled using react-hot-toast, and unit tests are available in the tests folder.
- ⚡ **Minimal & Modern UI** – Designed with **React.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, **React-router-dom**, **JSON-server** and **Leaflet.js**.
